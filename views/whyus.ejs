  <h2>How It Started</h2>

  <p>
    bookeasy.online wasn’t born in a boardroom — it was born from real journeys,
    real guests, and years of firsthand experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    The platform was founded by an experienced guide and concierge who spent
    years supporting international travelers in
    <strong>Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Japan</strong>. From the charming streets of
    Ganja and Shaki to the bustling neighborhoods of Tokyo and Osaka, she guided
    people from around the world — helping them discover local culture and
    cuisine with ease.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through her work, she saw a repeating pattern: travelers struggling with
    language barriers, complicated reservations, and long email exchanges just
    to confirm a meal. Time and again, guests said the same thing — “We wish
    there was a simpler way.”
  </p>

  <p>
    That dream of a smoother booking experience stayed with her for years. But
    working full-time in Tokyo made it difficult to bring it to life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then came a turning point — she became a mother. During her maternity leave,
    in between caring for her son, she found time to build what had been living
    in her heart for so long. That’s how bookeasy.online was born.
  </p>

  <p>
    A platform built with love. Built from experience. Built for every traveler
    who just wants to explore and eat — without stress.
